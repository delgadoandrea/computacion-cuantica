    "\n",
    "This module is designed to introduce you to the basic commands and tools needed to run your first scientific computing application. We will start with basic commands to execute in a Unix Shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line is the text-based interface for the computer's operating system as a powerful alternative to the click-pointer interaction. It is a program that takes in commands and passes them on to the computer's operating system to run. For example, through the command line, you can create or delete files and edit their content. The advantage of using the command line is its power. You can run programs, write scripts to automate common tasks, and combine simple commands to handle difficult tasks. By the end of this session, you should be able to navigate, access, and modify files and folders on your computer - all without a mouse!\n",

But what is a command? A *command* is a text-based instruction to the computer to perform a specific task. For example, one of the commands you will use on a daily basis is *ls*.\n",

    "When you type *ls*, the command line looks at the directory you are in, and \"lists\" all the files and directories inside of it. You can try it now for yourself!"
